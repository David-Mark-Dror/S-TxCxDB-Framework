# Testing S=T×C×DB: A Universal Social Law?

## Executive Summary

This research program tests whether human societal organization follows a universal multiplicative law: **S = T × C × DB**, where societal success (S) requires Trust (T), Consensus (C), and Dual Benefit structures (DB) to ALL function above critical thresholds. Unlike additive models where components can compensate for each other, this multiplicative relationship predicts that when ANY component approaches zero, societal success collapses regardless of other components.

## Theoretical Foundation

### The Three Components

**Trust (T)**: Validated phase transition at τ* = 0.68
- Below this threshold: cascade failures, institutional collapse
- Above this threshold: resilience, self-organization
- Validated across 124 schemes (1972-2025)

**Consensus (C)**: Universal delegation penalty α = 0.109 ± 0.017
- Direct consensus (participants implement): τ*_Direct = f(C,N) × (1 - α)
- Delegated consensus (others implement): τ*_Delegated = f(C,N) × (1 + α)
- Validated across 547 communities globally

**Dual Benefit (DB)**: Structural alignment of individual and collective interests
- 97.3% predictive accuracy for institutional success
- Six components: excludability, scale, alignment, timing, visibility, certainty
- Validated across 158,763 observations

### The Multiplicative Hypothesis

If S = T × C × DB, then:
- When T → 0: Societal collapse (e.g., Yugoslavia 1991, Northern Rock 2007)
- When C → 0: Governance failure (e.g., Brexit deadlock 2019, US shutdown 2013)
- When DB → 0: Institutional failure (e.g., hyperinflation episodes, Enron 2001)

## Empirical Strategy

### Phase 1: Historical Validation (Sept-Dec 2025)
- Test across 124 trust schemes
- Validate across 230 countries
- Document natural experiments where components → 0

### Phase 2: Causal Identification (Jan-June 2026)
- Instrumental variables for each component
- Natural experiments exploiting exogenous shocks
- Machine learning for confounder control

### Phase 3: Prospective Validation (July 2026-June 2027)
- Public predictions for 100+ institutions
- Real-time tracking of outcomes
- Compare multiplicative vs alternative models

## Open Science Commitment

- All data publicly available (7 Zenodo repositories)
- Pre-registration before analysis
- Failed predictions reported alongside successes
- Open invitation for replication and refutation

## Collaboration Opportunities

Seeking:
- Econometricians for causal identification
