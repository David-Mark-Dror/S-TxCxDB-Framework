These predictions are based on the universal trust threshold τ* = 0.68 validated across 124 schemes (1972-2024).

## What's Predicted:
- Trust threshold crossings for specific countries
- Development program success/failure outcomes
- Differential recovery patterns from economic shocks
- Quantitative validation of the τ* = 0.68 threshold

## Falsification Conditions:
Our theory will be considered failed if:
- Any country with T < 0.68 achieves program success rate > 70%
- Any country with all TCD components > 0.70 experiences systemic collapse
- The threshold appears at different value (not 0.68 ± 0.02)
